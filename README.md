Expense Sharing Application (Splitwise-like Backend)

A simplified expense sharing backend system inspired by Splitwise, built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL.
The application supports group-based expense sharing, multiple split types, balance tracking, and balance simplification.

This project focuses on correct system design, database modeling, and balance calculation logic, rather than UI polish.

Features

Create users

Create groups and add users to groups

Add shared expenses

Supported split types:

Equal split

Exact amount split

Percentage split

Track balances:

Who owes whom

How much a user owes

How much others owe a user

Balance simplification to minimize transactions

Simple HTML/CSS UI for testing APIs

Fully testable via Postman

Database Schema (Core Tables)

users
Stores user details

expense_groups
Stores group information

group_members
Maps users to groups (many-to-many relationship)

expenses
Stores expense details such as payer, amount, and split type

expense_splits
Stores individual user shares for each expense

This separation ensures accurate balance calculation and scalability.
